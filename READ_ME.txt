========================

This program  was written to be running all the time, so there's no technical reason
why it has to ever be stopped.  It doesn't consume any resources on the computer unless it's
actively processing a job.  You can, however, start it when you're ready to use it and stop
it afterward if you like.

The idea was that the daemon is always just sitting there waiting for people to give it a job to do
so it's not necessary to alway stop/start it, you just drop jobs into the hopper at will and the results
pop out the other end.

To start the program, it should be possible to just double-click on the jobd.bat file.
This should open a cmd window and start the daemon. Leave the cmd window open as long as there are 
jobs in the "working" folder.
